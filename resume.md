### Creating a chat bot with Python
I developed an automated bot for Discord, a popular instant messaging service. Python’s asynchronous
capabilities and the discord.py API were utilized to interface with the chat platform. You can view the

### Mobile application development with React Native
I created a simple RSS reader application with **React Native**. Its initial version was made in 3 days for a
React Native course I took in my university, but I decided to keep working on it to add new features like
adding feeds from QR codes. You can view the source [here][rss-reader-app].

### Simple web application with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript
I created a simple web application with a couple of my friends using vanilla JavaScript as a means of learning
the language. It is a website for browsing Finnish Ticketmaster events, aptly named **Ticketmapster**.

### Programming games with Ruby
I have contributed to **Pokémon Essentials**, the open-source video game framework that seeks to emulate the
2D Pokémon games. Running on legacy Ruby code, I've helped refactor its massive, old codebase to meet modern standards.
See the refactor branch of my fork [here][essentials-refactor].
