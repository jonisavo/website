Apprentice Councelor

My responsibilities included serving our clients by making appointments with professional translators

library designed for immigrants.

## IT background
<span style="float: right; ">2019 - Present</span>
### Creating a chat bot with Python
I developed an automated bot for Discord, a popular instant messaging service. Python’s asynchronous
capabilities and the discord.py API were utilized to interface with the chat platform. You can view the
source [here][zedrogames-bot].

### System management with Linux
I bought a Virtual Private Server running **Debian Linux** to host my web (nginx), mail (Postfix, Dovecot,
OpenDKIM, SpamAssassin) and Git servers.

## Programming

### Simple web application with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript
I created a simple web application with a couple of my friends using vanilla JavaScript as a means of learning
the language. It is a website for browsing Finnish Ticketmaster events, aptly named **Ticketmapster**.
See the source [here][ticketmapster].

### Programming games with Ruby
I have contributed to **Pokémon Essentials**, the open-source video game framework that seeks to emulate the
2D Pokémon games. Running on legacy Ruby code, I've helped refactor its massive, old codebase to meet modern standards.
See the refactor branch of my fork [here][essentials-refactor].
