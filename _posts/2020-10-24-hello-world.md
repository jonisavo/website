All big boy programmers have their own website, right? Well, behold! A shiny website made by yours truly.

...Okay, it's not all by me. In fact, only a small portion is. I have to give a shoutout to [knhash][knhash] for
creating the theme I based the site on. I've made some adjustments to it, and plan to change it a bunch more.
Having a good starting point helped tremendously in setting things up.

While a website as simple as this would be wouldn't be difficult to create with HTML and CSS only, I figured I
should use a static site generator to make my life a little easier. [Hugo][hugo] seemed promising, but I ultimately
settled on [Jekyll][jekyll] because of my familiarity with Ruby. (I've been meaning to learn Go for a while now,
but there are countless other things vying for my attention.)

That being said, I'm pretty excited to start writing about some of the things I've experienced
while working on my projects. There's plenty of stories to share!
