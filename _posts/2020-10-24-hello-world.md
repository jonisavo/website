All big boy programmers have their own website, right? Well, behold! A shiny website made by yours truly.

...Okay, it's not all by me. In fact, only a small portion is. While a website as simple as this wouldn't be a nightmare to create
with HTML and CSS only, I figured I should use a static site generator to make my life a little easier. [Jekyll][jekyll] seemed like
the right fit for the job.
