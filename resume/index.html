              <p>
                Recently, I had the pleasure to work with a group of students on <a href="https://jonisavo.itch.io/lucys-dream">Lucy's Dream</a>,
                a horror game that takes place in two dimensions. The game was developed with Unity. I was the "code lead", and responsible
                for the implementation plans of many of the game's systems. I lead five coders on the project.
              </p>
              <p>
                The game received great feedback from players, and we managed to reach third place in the
                <a href="https://www.bit1.fi/">Bit1 student game awards</a>!
              </p>
              <p>
                I also have experience porting my Unity projects for the PlayStation 4. Various PS4
                development and profiling tools were used to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize
                the games to run smoothly on the console.
              </p>
              <p>
                As for multiplayer games, I have a made a simple online Space
                Invaders clone, which you can see <a href="https://github.com/jonisavo/space-invaders-vs">here</a>.
              </p>
              <b>Packages</b>
              <p>
                I have created a small front-end framework for Unity's new UIToolkit system,
                <a href="https://github.com/jonisavo/uicomponents">UIComponents</a>.
                It has 100% unit test coverage and has a continuous integration pipeline in place to help catch bugs. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I created the package to ease the development of <a href="https://github.com/jonisavo/unitygit">UnityGit</a>,
                another project of mine. It provides an interface for Git operations inside the Unity Editor.

              <p>
                I think the biggest thing I've learned from working in the software development industry is
                just how important continuous integration and unit testing is. That's why I've made it a priority
                to set up a proper CI pipeline and test suite for all my new projects. You can see examples of it in
                <a href="https://github.com/jonisavo/parallel-cmd">parallel-cmd</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jonisavo/uicomponents">UIComponents</a>.

              <p>
                I feel like the most fun part of software development is finding new ways to do things
                in an easier and simpler way. That's why I've been focused on creating various tools
                and frameworks to do just that: make certain things more simple and fun.
              </p>

                Examples of this include the aforementioned

              <p>
                Although the bulk of my code is TypeScript and C#, I have experience with Ruby and C++ as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                My first code was written in Ruby for RPG Maker XP. As an example of my Ruby code, see this
                <a href="https://github.com/Maruno17/pokemon-essentials/pull/91">pull request</a>
                for Pok√©mon Essentials, where I introduce a new, more extensible system for save data.
              </p>
              <p>
                As an example of C(++) code, see <a href="https://gitlab.com/mkxp-z/mkxp-z/-/merge_requests/31">this</a>
                and <a href="https://gitlab.com/mkxp-z/mkxp-z/-/merge_requests/34">this</a> pull request on a game engine,
                where I implement a debug console for Windows, and promptly fix it after realizing I had
                messed it up the first time.
