              I've helped develop a mobile app for interacting with a BLE mesh. 
              Used technologies include TypeScript, Angular, Capacitor, Ionic Framework, Ionic AppFlow,
              Python and more. I've also gained plenty of knowledge about BLE devices and communication.

              I have been part of an Agile development team utilizing Jira, Bitbucket and GitHub.

              I have experience creating games for the PlayStation 4 with Unity. Used technologies
              include Unity Engine, C#, Visual Studio and various PS4 development and profiling tools.

              I began creating video games using RPG Maker 2003, a piece of software designed for
              developing RPG games. I became fascinated at game design at a very early age; I remember
              firing up Sonic the Hedgehog on my uncle's Mega Drive to jump into debug mode and place
              objects all over the place.
            </p>
            <p>
              Soon after, I picked up the basics of Doom Builder and built very primitive Doom levels.
              The baddies in Doom scared me as a kid, so all of my levels were really easy.
            </p>
            <p>
              RPG Maker XP had Ruby scripting built-in, and that's where I started programming. I still
              have a soft spot for Ruby, and occasionally dabble with it to this day.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also have experience writing C# in Unity. I have a made a simple online Space
              Invaders clone, seen <a href="https://github.com/jonisavo/space-invaders-vs">here</a>.

              I created a simple RSS reader application with React Native. Its initial version was
              made in 3 days for a React Native course I took in my university, but I decided to keep
              working on it to add new features like adding feeds from QR codes. You can view the
              source <a href="https://github.com/jonisavo/simple-rss-reader">here</a>.

              I've gained experience of Angular development through my job as a Software
              Engineer Trainee, listed above.
