                I've helped develop a mobile app for interacting with a BLE mesh. 
                Used technologies include TypeScript, Angular, Capacitor, Ionic Framework, Ionic AppFlow,
                Python and more. I've also gained plenty of knowledge about BLE devices and communication.

                I have experience creating games for the PlayStation 4 with Unity. Used technologies

                I began creating video games using RPG Maker 2003, a piece of software designed for
                developing RPG games. I became fascinated at game design at a very early age; I remember
                firing up Sonic the Hedgehog on my uncle's Mega Drive to jump into debug mode and place
                objects all over the place.

                Soon after, I picked up the basics of Doom Builder and built very primitive Doom levels.
                The baddies in Doom scared me as a kid, so all of my levels were really easy.

                RPG Maker XP had Ruby scripting built-in, and that's where I started programming. I still
                have a soft spot for Ruby, and occasionally dabble with it to this day.

                I also have experience writing C# in Unity. I have a made a simple online Space

                I created a simple RSS reader application with <mark></mark>React Native. Its initial version was
                made in 3 days for a React Native course I took in my university, but I decided to keep
                working on it to add new features like adding feeds from QR codes. You can view the
